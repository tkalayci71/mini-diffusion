inside webui environment, without having to install anything else, since I should already have all the files needed. This works only for SD1.x.

I'm not sure if there already exists a low level api to do this, webui code is hard to follow, with lots of layers and wrappers. 

I did this as an exercise in python which I'm still learning.
